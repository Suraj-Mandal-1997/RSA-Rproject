## **Introduction** 

 
 
This report was developed by a group of 4 people Mudit Bhargava, Suraj Sankar Mandal, Athithan Thiruppathy Selvam and Sangamithra Varadarajan for the Mini Project to analyse on the outcome of the National Car Testing Services “NCT" testing results. The National Car Test (NCT) was introduced in Ireland in January 2000 as part of an EU Directive that makes car testing compulsory in all member states. 

The analysis presented herein is based on the data from Road safety authority https://www.rsa.ie/RSA/Your-Vehicle/Your-Vehicle-/NCT-Statistics-/. There are datasets from 2013-2018 giving pass/fail rates by car testing center and by make and model of car. 
In this article, we have examined the data and rendered reports in 2 categories.<br>
Part I -  Fail & Pass Counts of Top 10 Makes for the year 2018, followed by components leading to Test failure is plotted to understand the most vulnerable parts in all the models of the Top10 Make. 
(Note: Top 10 makes are identified based on the largest number of vehicles by distinctive make appeared for the test)
Part II-  A trend Analysis is conducted on the passing percentiles of the vehicle's test center-wide 2015 till 2018 and the overall count of vehicles undergone NCT Test from 2015 to 2018.

The chart above reflects the pass/fail count of  Top 10 makes in the 1st round of testing in the year 2018. It is observed that pass and failure count are proportionately almost equal. We can see more than 50 % pass rate for the Makes like Toyota, Audi, BMW, and Hyundai. Whereas  Makes like Volkswagen, Ford, Nissan, Opel, Renault, and Peugeot have low pass rates. To understand further a component level failure analysis is carried to discern which component of make is letting more failure.

# Plot
ggplot(data=x.prop)+geom_bar(aes(x=Make,y=proportion*100,fill=Component),stat="identity", position=position_dodge(),width=200,show.legend = TRUE,color="white")+
  labs(x="Vehicle Makes",y="Components failure percent %",title="Component Failure Percentiles of Top 10 Makes",fill="Components")+ theme_light()+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_blank(),panel.grid = element_blank(),axis.ticks.x=element_blank(),strip.background = element_rect(fill="#5160A9"))+
  facet_wrap(~Make,nrow=2) +theme(panel.background = element_rect(fill=NA,color="black", size=0.5, 
                                                              linetype="solid"))


```

From the component level graph above of Top 10 makes there’s a high rate of failure percentage due to the failure of the Lighting_Electircals component for all the 10 Makes. Other components like Wheels and Brake has caused failure to make like Audi and Toyota respectively. There are very rare instances where we have seen the failure due to chassis and side-slip. Hopefully, the failures in the 1st round have been addressed to pass the retest which is reflected in overall avg pass percentage of approximately 96% in the county wise graph(Graph3)

#### _Pass and Fail based on County_
From the charts below, the Count of Vehicles tested year on year from 2015  till 2018 has lowered but there is a slight increase in the pass percentile by 1% in most of the counties. Testing has been conducted in 2 rounds and its observed that only 50% of the vehicles passed in the 1st attempt and have undergone retest to arrive the mean final pass percentage of 95%.

A large number of vehicles of over 10,000 & above are tested in centers at Deansgrange, Northpoint 1 & Northpoint2, Fonthill& Cork-Little highland. The average pass percentage is seen to be around 95% regardless of the Test Centers in counties each year. County  Monaghan is having a high Failure count of roughly 8% from 2015 till 2017 and improved by 1 % in 2018. Highest Pass Percentile of around  98%observed at Derrybeg in 2017 & 2018&  at Cahirciveen in 2015 &2016 out of the 4000 Vehicles tested approximately. Graph 2, Clearly animates the trend of vehicles serviced for NCT Test, going down over the years from 2015 till 2018.

### _Summary_ 
Through this report, we have tried to understand the passing trend, Number of cars tested every year. Identified the Top 10 makes based on the largest count of vehicles and the component causing failures in these makes. It is found that the number of cars that are being tested is gradually decreasing over the years. Cars Make like Toyota, Volkswagen, Ford, and Nissan are the most used in 2018. Engine and chassis are the least failed components across all cars, whereas the Electrical, Steering, and Brakes are the most failing components.
Approximately 95% of the vehicles are passing the NCT test in an average each year in the Final round although around 50% failure is observed in the first round of testing.
